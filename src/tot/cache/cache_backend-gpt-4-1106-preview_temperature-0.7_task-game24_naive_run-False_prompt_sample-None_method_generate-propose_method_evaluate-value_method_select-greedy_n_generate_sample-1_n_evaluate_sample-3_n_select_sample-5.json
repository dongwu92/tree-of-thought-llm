    "Speak briefly. Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. Given an input and an answer, give a judgement (sure/impossible) if the answer is correct, i.e. it uses each input exactly once and no other numbers, and reach 24.\nInput: 4 4 6 8\nAnswer: (4 + 8) * (6 - 4) = 24\nJudge: \nsure\nInput: 2 9 10 12\nAnswer: 2 * 12 * (10 - 9) = 24\nJudge: \nsure\nInput: 4 9 10 13\nAnswer: (13 - 9) * (10 - 4) = 24\nJudge: \nsure\nInput: 4 4 6 8\nAnswer: (4 + 8) * (6 - 4) + 1 = 25\nJudge: \nimpossible\nInput: 2 9 10 12\nAnswer: 2 * (12 - 10) = 24\nJudge: \nimpossible\nInput: 4 9 10 13\nAnswer: (13 - 4) * (10 - 9) = 24\nJudge: \nimpossible\nInput: 3 3 5 12\nAnswer: 14 / 6 (not a whole number, typically not used in sequences like this)\nJudge:": [
